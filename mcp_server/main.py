Defaults, examples, and\npossible values are additionally rendered in double quotes for readability. In practice, query parameters should\nnot have quotes around the values (e.g., `foo=bar` is valid, not `foo="bar"`), and both query parameter keys\nand values must be percent-encoded, per the requirements in [RFC 3986 § 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nIn order to provide a fair distribution of available resources, all API calls are subject to rate limits.\nIf you exceed the number of API calls per minute granted to your credential, a `429 Too Many Requests`\nerror response will be returned.\n\nIn that case, a `Retry-After` header MAY be included in the response, describing the number of seconds\nafter which a request can be retried.\n\nIf you run into a high number of 429 errors, please reach out to ART19 Support to adjust your rate limit.\n\n### Example\n\nIn the following example the request can be retried after waiting for 21 seconds:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\n    Content-Type: text/html\n    Retry-After: 21\n\n## Pagination\n\nRequests to collection endpoints **SHOULD** provide pagination parameters.\nSome endpoints **REQUIRE** pagination parameters to be provided.\nWhenever pagination is provided, it **MUST** be valid.\nFailing to provide pagination when it is required or providing wrong or incomplete pagination\nalways results in a `400 Bad Request` error response.\n\nThe page numbering starts with `1` and the maximum page size (if not otherwise documented\non an endpoint) is `100`. Pagination **MUST NOT** be specified if requesting a list of IDs (using an `ids[]` parameter).\n\nProviding invalid values for page number or page size, as well as providing only a page number or only a page size,\nis considered an error. Pagination is provided like this:\n\n`page[number]=1&page[size]=25`\n\nResponses conform to the [JSON:API specification\'s pagination section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)\nby including pagination links. Your requested page size will be carried into the pagination links.\n\n## Sorting\n\nRequests to collection endpoints usually accept a `sort` parameter. Please refer to the\n[JSON:API Specification\'s sorting section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) for further details.\n\n## Relationship Linking\n\nCurrently, resources return all of their relationships, in no particular order, pursuant to how relationships\nshould be returned [according to the JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Consumers of this API\n**MUST NOT** make assumptions about the order of these collections. Even though this data is not currently paginated, consumers **MUST** support\npaginating relationships per the JSON:API specification if this data is important for their application.\n',

and is _owned_ by an entity called the `bucket`.
An image is also a container for several `MediaAssets` representing the physical files for various
styles used.

## Media Asset Styles for Images

Most media assets use square images. You may upload and use a square image, or upload an image of any
shape and crop it to a square by specifying the cropping area. This area – identified by a coordinate
`x, y` and a `width` & `height` – is the portion of the image used for all cover art. If an image has
cropping defined, the cropped version of the image will be used in any `regular` or `square` style of media
asset. If the original file is rectangular and does not have cropping, then the system will use a squared
version of the original file with the smaller of width or height as the square size.

The original image as uploaded into the system is always retained unmodified and available through
the style `original`. All media asset styles except `stripped-original` consist of the cropped image.

An image has media assets with the following styles:

- `original`: This is the original file provided. May not be available, depending on permissions
  and file type.
- `stripped-original`: The original file with all metadata (EXIF, XMP, PNG metadata, etc.) removed.
  This should be used for any application needing the original, uncropped, image.
- `regular`: If the image has cropping defined, this is the cropped image.
  If not, this is a square version of the original.
- `thumb`: A square thumbnail of the image with a size of `100x100` pixels.
- `square-400`: A square version of the image with a size of `400x400` pixels.
- `square-640`: A square version of the image with a size of `640x640` pixels.
- `square-888`: A square version of the image with a size of `888x888` pixels.
- `square-3000`: A square version of the image with a size of `3000x3000` pixels.
  This variant is only created if the cropped width & height are each at least 3000.
- `itunes`: A square version of the image with a size of `1400x1400` pixels.

### Preferred image used in feeds

For the main series image used in feeds, it is ideal to use the `square-3000` version.
If that is not available, the `itunes` version should be used instead.
